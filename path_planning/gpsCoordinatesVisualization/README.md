# Thunderhill GPS Coordinates Visualization

One of the first thing we wanted to find out at Thunderhill, was how actuate the MTi-G-710 GPS was in following the Kia Soul around the Thunderhill West track, so we generated a script for displaying the GPS data collected during our test laps.  As it turns out the mapping was actually acceptable (within 1-2 meters).

## Usage

Install the following required python package:

- csv

Run the following script in a dataset directory with the `output.txt` is located:

```
python drawDataSetTrack.py
```

This will generate a coorindates.html file that will render a google map image of the path that the Kia Soul took during the test lap.

## Visualization from Day 1

Below are the results from each of our test laps for the first day at Thunderhill West:
